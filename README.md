# 🌾 YieldIQ

**AI-Powered Agricultural Intelligence for the Modern Farmer**

YieldIQ is a scientifically-backed precision agriculture platform designed to empower farmers with data-driven insights. By combining Google Gemini's advanced parsing capabilities with established agronomy models (FAO-56 & Maas-Hoffman), YieldIQ transforms raw lab reports and real-time telemetry into actionable harvest forecasts and irrigation schedules.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔬 Scientific Advisory**: Automatically parse IS-10500 water/soil reports to calculate salinity penalties, sodicity hazards (SAR/RSC), and soil structural risks.
- **📈 Harvest Forecasting**: High-accuracy yield predictions based on soil type, crop variety, and real-time weather conditions from Open-Meteo.
- **💧 Dynamic Irrigation**: Live irrigation scheduling derived from ETo (Evapotranspiration) and crop-specific coefficients (Kc).
- **📡 Intelligence Pipeline**: Visualize the flow of data from edge sensors through standardization and normalization into AI insights.
- **🗣️ Multilingual Assistant**: A conversational AI that speaks the farmer's language (Hindi, Marathi, English) to provide expert guidance.
- **🗺️ GIS Visualization**: Satellite-level insights including NDVI health indexing and moisture mapping.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI.
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore).
- **Generative AI**: Google Genkit 1.x, Gemini 2.5 Flash.
- **Data APIs**: Open-Meteo (Weather & Hydrology).
- **Charts**: Recharts.
